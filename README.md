# Webscraping
 
Authors: Mahrukh Khan, Jameson Carter

Project aimed to map black-owned businesses in Pittsburgh, United States. We scraped the online directory to create a dataset of black-owned businesses, geocoded the dataset in ArcGIS, and published the [story map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/73ed746ecaad4ffe8693658b58d6eca0) at ArcGIS Online. Additional feature layers include bus routes, walkability, and neighborhood boundaries.
